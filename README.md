# Tandy Webring

Welcome Owner-Member!

A webring is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure. The webring appears as a widget on the bottom of a website, with buttons linking to the next and previous websites in the ring. This gives online communities the power to direct people to other sites in that community instead of relying on search engines.

This project contains both the code that powers the Tandy Webring, and a website with information regarding the webring
